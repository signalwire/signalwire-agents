Enhanced InfoGatherer example demonstrating dynamic configuration via callback

This example shows how to use the InfoGathererAgent with a callback function
to dynamically configure questions based on request parameters.

Test URLs:
- /contact (default questions)
- /contact?set=support (customer support questions)
- /contact?set=medical (medical intake questions)
- /contact?set=onboarding (employee onboarding questions)
