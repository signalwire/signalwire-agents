Simple Dynamic Agent - Enhanced Example

This example shows the REAL POWER of dynamic configuration by actually using
request parameters to customize the agent behavior.

Same base agent as the previous examples, but now it adapts based on:
- vip: true/false (changes voice and response speed)
- department: sales/support/billing (changes expertise and prompts)
- customer_id: any string (personalizes the experience)
- language: en/es (changes language and voice)

Usage:
    python simple_dynamic_enhanced.py

Available at: http://localhost:3000/

Try these requests to see the differences:

1. Basic request (default configuration):
   curl "http://localhost:3000"

2. VIP customer:
   curl "http://localhost:3000?vip=true&customer_id=CUST123"

3. Sales department with Spanish:
   curl "http://localhost:3000?department=sales&language=es&customer_id=Maria"

4. Billing support:
   curl "http://localhost:3000?department=billing&vip=true"

5. Compare the /debug endpoint:
   curl "http://localhost:3000/debug?vip=true&department=sales&customer_id=CUST456"
