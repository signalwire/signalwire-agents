FAQ Bot Agent Example

This example demonstrates how to create a specialized agent 
for answering frequently asked questions from a knowledge base.

Key concepts demonstrated:
1. Creating a domain-specific agent for FAQs
2. Structuring knowledge in the prompt
3. Using declarative prompt templates 
4. Customizing agent behavior at runtime
