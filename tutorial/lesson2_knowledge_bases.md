## Understanding Vector Search

Vector search allows your agent to find relevant information from large document collections using semantic similarity rather than exact keyword matching.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Semantic Understanding**: Finds related content even with different wording
- **Scalability**: Efficiently searches through thousands of documents
- **Context Awareness**: Returns the most relevant passages for the query
- **Real-time Updates**: Knowledge bases can be updated without changing code

**How It Works:**

1. Documents are converted into numerical vectors (embeddings)
2. User queries are converted to vectors using the same method
3. The system finds documents with similar vectors
4. Most relevant passages are returned to the agent

---

## Installing Search Dependencies

The search functionality requires additional packages for document processing and vector operations.

### Option 1: Basic Search (Recommended)

```bash
# Install with basic search support (~500MB)
pip install -e .[search]
```

This includes:
- Sentence transformers for embeddings
- Basic document processing
- SQLite for index storage

### Option 2: Full Document Processing

```bash
# Install with full document support (~600MB)
pip install -e .[search-full]
```

Additional features:
- PDF processing
- Word/Excel document support
- Advanced text extraction

### Option 3: Query-Only (Production)

```bash
# Minimal installation for querying existing indexes (~400MB)
pip install -e .[search-queryonly]
```

Use this when:
- You only need to query pre-built indexes
- Minimizing deployment size is important
- Index building happens elsewhere

### Dealing with PyTorch Compatibility

Some systems may have issues with PyTorch's CPU optimizations:

```bash
# Disable AVX512 if you encounter illegal instruction errors
export PYTORCH_DISABLE_AVX512=1

# Disable AVX2 on older CPUs
export PYTORCH_DISABLE_AVX2=1
```

---

## Creating Knowledge Bases

Knowledge bases are markdown files containing information your agent can search. Let's examine the existing sales knowledge base:

### sales_knowledge.md Structure

```markdown
# PC Builder Pro Sales Knowledge Base

## Gaming PC Builds

### Budget Gaming Build ($800-$1000)
- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X or Intel Core i5-12400F
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 4060 or AMD RX 7600
- **RAM**: 16GB DDR4 3200MHz (2x8GB)
- **Storage**: 500GB NVMe SSD
...

### Mid-Range Gaming Build ($1500-$2000)
- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 7 7700X or Intel Core i5-13600K
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 4070 or AMD RX 7800 XT
...
```

**Best Practices for Knowledge Documents:**

1. **Use Clear Headings**: Organize with markdown headers
2. **Be Specific**: Include model numbers, prices, specifications
3. **Structure Consistently**: Similar sections should follow similar patterns
4. **Update Regularly**: Keep information current

---

## Building Search Indexes

The `sw-search` CLI tool converts markdown documents into searchable indexes.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Build a search index from markdown files
sw-search ./tutorial --output sales_knowledge.swsearch

# Specify file types to include
sw-search ./tutorial --file-types md --output sales_knowledge.swsearch

# Build with PyTorch compatibility flags
PYTORCH_DISABLE_AVX512=1 sw-search ./tutorial --output sales_knowledge.swsearch
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Include multiple directories
sw-search ./docs ./examples ./tutorial --output combined.swsearch

# Specify chunk size for splitting documents
sw-search ./tutorial --chunk-size 512 --output sales_knowledge.swsearch

# Add metadata tags
sw-search ./tutorial --tags "product,sales" --output sales_knowledge.swsearch
```

### Validating Indexes

```bash
# Validate an existing index
sw-search validate ./sales_knowledge.swsearch

# Search within an index from command line
sw-search search ./sales_knowledge.swsearch "gaming PC under $1000"
```

### Building Our Tutorial Indexes

Since we already have the knowledge base files, let's verify the indexes:

```bash
# The indexes are already built, but here's how they were created:
PYTORCH_DISABLE_AVX512=1 sw-search tutorial/sales_knowledge.md \
  --output tutorial/sales_knowledge.swsearch

PYTORCH_DISABLE_AVX512=1 sw-search tutorial/support_knowledge.md \
  --output tutorial/support_knowledge.swsearch
```

---

## Adding Search to Your Agent

Now let's enhance Morgan with the ability to search the knowledge base.

### Step 1: Add the Search Skill

```python
# In the __init__ method, after language configuration:
self.add_skill("native_vector_search", {
    "tool_name": "search_sales_knowledge",
    "description": "Search sales and product information",
    "index_file": "sales_knowledge.swsearch",
    "count": 3  # Return top 3 results
})
```

### Step 2: Update the Workflow

Add instructions for using the search tool:

```python
self.prompt_add_section(
    "Your Tasks",
    body="Complete sales process workflow with passion and expertise:",
    bullets=[
        "Greet customers warmly and introduce yourself",
        "Understand their specific PC building requirements",
        "Ask about budget, intended use, and preferences",
        "Use search_sales_knowledge to find relevant product information",
        "Provide knowledgeable recommendations based on search results",
        "Share your enthusiasm for PC building",
        "Offer to explain technical details when helpful"
    ]
)
```

### Step 3: Add Tool Usage Section

```python
self.prompt_add_section(
    "Tools Available",
    body="Use these tools to assist customers:",
    bullets=[
        "search_sales_knowledge: Find current product information and build recommendations",
        "Search when customers ask about specific budgets or use cases",
        "Use search results to provide accurate, up-to-date information"
    ]
)
```

## Testing Knowledge Queries

### Method 1: Using swaig-test

```bash
# List available tools
swaig-test tutorial/sales_agent_with_search.py --list-tools

# Test the search function
swaig-test tutorial/sales_agent_with_search.py \
  --exec search_sales_knowledge \
  --query "gaming PC under $1500"
```

### Method 2: Interactive Testing

When you call the agent, try these prompts:
- "I need a gaming PC for around $1000"
- "What's the best build for video editing?"
- "Can you recommend components for a high-end gaming system?"

### Method 3: Direct Search Testing

```bash
# Test the search index directly
sw-search search tutorial/sales_knowledge.swsearch "RTX 4070"
```

### Understanding Search Results

The search returns structured data:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "content": "### Mid-Range Gaming Build ($1500-$2000)\n- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 7 7700X...",
      "score": 0.892,
      "metadata": {
        "source": "sales_knowledge.md",
        "chunk_index": 2
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Fields:**
- `content`: The relevant text passage
- `score`: Relevance score (0-1, higher is better)
- `metadata`: Source information

---

## Best Practices

### Knowledge Base Design

**DO:**
- ✅ Keep information current and accurate
- ✅ Use consistent formatting
- ✅ Include specific model numbers and prices
- ✅ Organize with clear hierarchies
- ✅ Update regularly as products change

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Include outdated information
- ❌ Use inconsistent terminology
- ❌ Create overly long sections
- ❌ Mix different types of information

### Search Integration

**Effective Patterns:**

1. **Acknowledge Searching**:
   ```
   "Let me search for the best options in your budget..."
   "I'll find the latest recommendations for gaming builds..."
   ```

2. **Handle No Results**:
   ```
   "I don't have specific information about that, but based on similar builds..."
   ```

3. **Combine Results**:
   ```
   "Based on our current recommendations, I found three great options..."
   ```

### Performance Tips

1. **Index Size**: Keep indexes focused on specific domains
2. **Result Count**: 3-5 results is usually optimal
3. **Caching**: Indexes are loaded once and cached in memory
4. **Updates**: Rebuild indexes when knowledge changes significantly

---

## Summary

You've successfully enhanced Morgan with intelligent knowledge search! You've learned:

**Key Skills:**
- ✅ Installing search dependencies with different feature sets
- ✅ Understanding vector search and embeddings
- ✅ Building search indexes with sw-search
- ✅ Integrating the native_vector_search skill
- ✅ Testing search functionality

**What's Next?**

In the next lesson, you'll learn how to build multi-agent systems where different specialists work together. You'll create a complete customer service system with triage, sales, and support agents.

### Practice Exercises

1. **Create a Custom Knowledge Base**: Write a markdown file about PC accessories (monitors, keyboards, mice) and build an index
2. **Adjust Search Parameters**: Try different `count` values to see how it affects responses
3. **Add Search Refinement**: Update prompts to ask clarifying questions before searching
4. **Test Edge Cases**: See how the agent handles queries with no good matches

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

- **Module not found**: Ensure you installed with `pip install -e .[search]`
- **Index file not found**: Check the path is relative to where you run the agent
- **PyTorch errors**: Set `PYTORCH_DISABLE_AVX512=1` environment variable
- **Empty results**: Verify the index was built from the correct files
